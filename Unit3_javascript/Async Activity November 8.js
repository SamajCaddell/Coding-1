'Start with a Letter or Underscore: Variable names must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). They cannot start with a number.'
'No Special Characters: Variable names can include letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot contain spaces or special characters.'
'Case Sensitivity: Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVariable, MyVariable, and MYVARIABLE are considered different variables.'
'Variable Name Formats.'
'Camel Case: This format capitalizes the first letter of each word except the first one, with no spaces or underscores.'
'Snake Case: This format uses lowercase letters and underscores to separate words.'
'Pascal Case: Similar to camel case, but the first letter of every word is capitalized, including the first one.'

let a = 100; // Assigning 100 to a
let b = a * 7; // Now b will be 700
console.log(b); // Output: 700

var x = 12;
var y = 2;
var z = 12 / 4;
if (x <= 12 && z < 10)
