The equal sign is used as an assignment operator in programming, assigning the value on the right to the variable on the left (e.g., x = 5). It also denotes equality in mathematics.
2. Logical AND (&&)
The double ampersand (&&) is a logical AND operator that returns true only if both boolean expressions are true (e.g., if (a > 0 && b > 0)).
3. Logical OR (||)
The double vertical bar (||) is a logical OR operator that returns true if at least one of the boolean expressions is true (e.g., if (a > 0 || b > 0)).

The double equals sign (==) is a comparison operator that checks if two values are equal.
